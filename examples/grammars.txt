<numberset>:
A number-set which starts with a <number> and contains only numbers and underscores

<number-literal>
A number-literal consists of (<number>, <numberset>, or <numberset>.<numberset>)

<string-literal>:
A string-literal starts with `"` and contains all characters until a unescaped `"` is reached or a new line.
String escape character is `\` with multiple escape values: \n, \b, \v, \t.
Variables are printed (scope based) via `{<identifier>} or {this.<identifier>} or {[<identifier = modulename>#](<identifier = classname>.<identifier>...).<identifier>}`
by concatinating the string to the value via `+ <identifier>`

A boolean literal consists of: `true` or `false`

<character-literal>
A character literal consists of: `'<letter>'` or `'\<letter>'`

<literal>:
A literal consists of (<number-literal>, <string-literal>, <character-literal>, or <boolean-literal>)

<modulename>:
A module-name is a <identifier> that connects a class to a specific module or directory

<refrence-pointer>:
A refrence ptr is a specific poibnter to any given variable, function, or class within an entity.
[<modulename>#]<identifier>*(.<identifier>)

<refrence-identifier>:
A reference identifier is an identifier that may be an <identifier> or <refrence-pointer>

<typeidentifier>:
An <nativetype> or <refrence-identifier>

<value>:
A value consists of an <refrence-identifier> or a <literal>

<accesstype>:
An access-type is a restriction in the level of access that a specific class, or variable.
For a class, the access types consist of: `protected (only accessable inside the module`
FOr variables, the access types consist of: `private (only accessable inside the class)`, or `protected (only accessable inside the module)`

<singleline-comment>:
